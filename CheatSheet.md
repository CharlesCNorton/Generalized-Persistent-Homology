Date: October 8th, 2024

## STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
---
- PH(k)(X): Persistent homology of topological space \( X \) in dimension \( k \).
- Topological Space Categories (X_categories):
  1. High-dimensional structure: \( X \) as a manifold embedded in \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
  2. Fractal-like structure: Fractals or self-similar structures, non-integer Hausdorff dimension \( d_H \).
  3. Non-smooth spaces: Polyhedral complexes, lacking smoothness.
  4. Singular varieties: Spaces with singularities (e.g., nodes, cusps).

## OPEN PROBLEM
---
### Problem Statement:
How do homological features (connected components, loops, voids) evolve under persistent homology across filtrations in complex topological spaces like fractals, non-smooth spaces, and singular varieties?

### Breakdown:
1. Behavior of Homological Features: What are the birth, persistence, and death times of \( H_0 \), \( H_1 \), and \( H_2 \) across filtrations?
2. Theoretical Guarantees: Can we provide closed-form expressions for persistence intervals and confirm the stability of persistent homology under perturbations?
3. Unified Approach: Can we merge the analysis of fractals, non-smooth spaces, and singular varieties into a single framework?

## FORMAL SOLUTION: CHARACTERIZING PH(k)(X)
---
### I. Persistent Homology of Fractals
#### Key Concepts:
- Fractal Set: \( F \), self-similarity factor \( s \), non-integer \( d_H \) (Hausdorff dimension).
- Recursive Structure: Generates periodic or quasi-periodic persistence intervals.
  
#### Filtration Process:
- Construct filtration \( \{ F_t \}_{t \geq 0} \), where each \( F_t \) approximates the fractal.
- Persistence intervals for \( H_k(F_t) \) are governed by scaling factor \( s \).
  
#### Closed-form Expression for Persistence Intervals:
- \( P_k(F) = \{ C_k \cdot s^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z} \} \), where \( C_k \) is a constant and \( s \) is the scaling factor.

#### Theoretical Guarantee:
- \( H_k(F) \neq 0 \text{ for } k \leq d_H \) (non-trivial homology up to dimension \( d_H \)).

### II. Persistent Homology of Non-Smooth Spaces
#### Key Concepts:
- Discrete Morse Theory: Assigns values to simplices, identifying critical simplices.
  
#### Persistence Intervals:
- Critical simplex \( \sigma^k \) gives persistence: \( \tau_k(\sigma^k) = f(\tau^{k+1}) - f(\sigma^k) \).
  
#### Closed-form Expression:
- \( P_k(X) = \sum_{\sigma^k \in X} \tau_k(\sigma^k) \), where \( \tau_k(\sigma^k) \) is the persistence of the critical simplex.

#### Key Guarantee:
- Critical simplices map directly to homological features (connected components, loops, voids).

### III. Persistent Homology for Singular Varieties
#### Key Concepts:
- Intersection Homology: Extends classical homology for singular spaces.
- Link \( L(p) \): Lower-dimensional space capturing local topology around singular point \( p \).

#### Persistence near Singularities:
- Spectral sequence \( E_r^{p,q} \rightarrow H_{p+q}(X) \) governs evolution of topological features near singularities.
  
#### Closed-form Expression:
- \( P_k(X) = P_k(X \setminus \Sigma) \cup \bigcup_{p \in \Sigma} P_k(L(p)) \), combining persistence from smooth and singular parts.

#### Key Guarantee:
- Persistent homology near singularities is accurately captured using spectral sequences and intersection homology.

## UNIFIED FRAMEWORK (COMBINING I, II, AND III)
---
### Unified Equation:
- \( PH_k(X) = PH_k(X_{\text{smooth}}) \cup \left(\sum_{\sigma^k \in X_{\text{non-smooth}}} \tau_k(\sigma^k) \right) \cup \left( \bigcup_{p \in \Sigma} PH_k(L(p)) \right) \).

#### Explanation:
- Smooth Part \( PH_k(X_{\text{smooth}}) \): Computed using classical filtration methods (e.g., Vietoris-Rips).
- Non-smooth Part \( \sum_{\sigma^k \in X_{\text{non-smooth}}} \tau_k(\sigma^k) \): Persistent homology computed using discrete Morse theory.
- Singular Part \( \bigcup_{p \in \Sigma} PH_k(L(p)) \): Computed using spectral sequences and intersection homology.

#### Theoretical Guarantees:
1. Stability: Persistence intervals remain stable under small perturbations.
2. Curvature Control: Persistence intervals near singular points are bounded by local curvature.
3. Homological Consistency: The unified framework preserves topological invariants such as the Euler characteristic.

## REFINED EQUATION AND SIMPLIFIED FORM
---
### Refined Equation:
For higher-dimensional singularities and non-uniform perturbations:
- \( PH_k(X) = PH_k(X_{\text{smooth}}) \cup \left( \sum_{\sigma^k \in X_{\text{non-smooth}}} \tau_k(\sigma^k) \right) \cup \left( \int_{\Sigma} PH_k(L(\sigma)) \right) \),
where \( \int_{\Sigma} PH_k(L(\sigma)) \) accounts for singular strata, allowing the equation to generalize beyond isolated singularities.

### Simplified Refined Equation:
In spaces with low-dimensional singularities:
- \( PH_k(X) = PH_k(X_{\text{smooth}}) \cup \left( \sum_{\sigma^k \in X_{\text{non-smooth}}} \tau_k(\sigma^k) \right) \cup \left( \bigcup_{p \in \Sigma} PH_k(L(p)) \right) \),
which focuses on the homological contributions from smooth, non-smooth, and isolated singular points.

## LEMMAS AND PROOFS
---
### Lemma 1: Stability of Persistent Homology
- Statement: Persistent homology intervals \( PH_k(X) \) are stable under perturbations. Let \( X' \) be a perturbed version of \( X \). Then \( d_{\text{bottleneck}}(PH_k(X), PH_k(X')) \leq \delta \), where \( \delta \) is a perturbation bound.
  
- Proof: Use bottleneck distance to compare persistence diagrams, applying stability theorem for filtrations.

### Lemma 2: Spectral Sequence Convergence for Singular Varieties
- Statement: The spectral sequence for singular varieties \( X \) converges to the homology groups \( H_k(X) \).
  
- Proof: Construct a filtration of the stratified space and compute the spectral sequence, showing convergence at \( E_\infty \).

### Lemma 3: Critical Simplices in Non-Smooth Spaces
- Statement: Critical simplices in non-smooth spaces determine persistent homology features.
  
- Proof: Apply discrete Morse theory and show how critical simplices relate to the persistence intervals.
