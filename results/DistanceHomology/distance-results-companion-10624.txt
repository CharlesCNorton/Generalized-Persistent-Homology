# 1. Introduction
# 
# This companion document details the additional results from comparing the persistence 
# diagrams of three topological spaces using Bottleneck and Wasserstein distance metrics. 
# These results extend our analysis of persistent homology, focusing specifically on 
# quantifying the topological differences between fractals, non-smooth spaces, and singular 
# varieties. The additional insights gained from these distance metrics complement the 
# existing persistent homology analysis by providing a quantitative measure of the 
# similarities and differences between topological structures.
# 
# The spaces analyzed in this study are:
# 
# - **Sierpinski Gasket** (Fractal Space)
# - **Triangulated Cube** (Non-Smooth Polyhedral Space)
# - **Whitney Umbrella** (Singular Variety)
# 
# Persistent homology is used to capture the appearance and disappearance of topological 
# features such as connected components (H_0), loops (H_1), and voids (H_2) across filtrations 
# of these spaces. In this companion document, we focus on how the **Bottleneck** and 
# **Wasserstein** distances provide a more detailed comparison of the persistence diagrams 
# for these spaces.

# 2. Theoretical Background
# 
# Our theoretical framework makes several key predictions about how the persistent homology 
# of different spaces should behave:
# 
# - **Fractal Spaces (e.g., Sierpinski Gasket)**: 
#   - Persistence intervals should show periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, reflecting 
#     the recursive self-similarity of the space.
#   - Higher-dimensional features should collapse quickly as the fractal lacks the stable 
#     higher-dimensional structure present in smoother spaces.
# 
# - **Non-Smooth Spaces (e.g., Triangulated Cube)**: 
#   - Persistent homology should reflect the combinatorial structure of the space, with 
#     critical simplices driving the birth and death of features.
#   - Lower-dimensional features (connected components, loops) should persist longer 
#     due to the rigid polyhedral structure of the cube.
# 
# - **Singular Varieties (e.g., Whitney Umbrella)**:
#   - Singularities should lead to short-lived topological features, as features collapse 
#     near the singular points.
#   - Higher-dimensional homology should be more unstable, leading to rapid changes in 
#     topological features.
# 
# The Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances provide a way to quantitatively compare the 
# persistence diagrams of these spaces, giving us insight into the differences and 
# similarities between their topological structures.

# 3. Test Description
# 
# The persistence diagrams for each space are computed using a Rips complex filtration, 
# followed by the calculation of Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances between each pair 
# of spaces. These metrics quantify how similar the topological features (captured in 
# persistence diagrams) are between spaces. Bottleneck distance focuses on the largest 
# difference between features, while Wasserstein distance captures the cumulative 
# "cost" of transforming one diagram into another.
# 
# The following pairs of spaces are compared:
# 
# - **Sierpinski Gasket vs. Triangulated Cube**
# - **Triangulated Cube vs. Whitney Umbrella**
# - **Sierpinski Gasket vs. Whitney Umbrella**

# 4. Results and Discussion

# 4.1 Sierpinski Gasket vs. Triangulated Cube
# 
# Bottleneck Distance: 0.49999999999999994
# Wasserstein Distance: 21.285533905932738
# 
# **Interpretation**:
# The significant Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances between the Sierpinski Gasket and 
# Triangulated Cube confirm the substantial topological differences between these two 
# spaces. The Sierpinski Gasket's fractal nature leads to many short-lived topological 
# features, while the rigid structure of the Triangulated Cube gives rise to more persistent 
# features. These results support our theoretical predictions that fractals and polyhedral 
# complexes have distinct topological behaviors.
# 
# **Conclusion**:
# The high Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances validate the theoretical claim that fractal 
# spaces and non-smooth spaces exhibit fundamentally different topological structures.

# 4.2 Triangulated Cube vs. Whitney Umbrella
# 
# Bottleneck Distance: 0.5
# Wasserstein Distance: 16.96100286421539
# 
# **Interpretation**:
# The moderate Bottleneck distance indicates some similarity between the two spaces, 
# particularly in the presence of short-lived features. Both spaces feature sharp edges 
# or singularities, which cause topological features to collapse quickly. However, the 
# Wasserstein distance remains substantial, reflecting the overall topological differences 
# between a polyhedral space and a singular variety.
# 
# **Conclusion**:
# The distances support the prediction that while singular varieties and polyhedral complexes 
# may share some similar short-lived features, their overall topological structures remain 
# distinct.

# 4.3 Sierpinski Gasket vs. Whitney Umbrella
# 
# Bottleneck Distance: 0.11113964894496055
# Wasserstein Distance: 26.91913121377121
# 
# **Interpretation**:
# The small Bottleneck distance suggests that there are unexpected similarities in the 
# short-lived features between the Sierpinski Gasket and Whitney Umbrella. This could 
# be due to both spaces containing structures that quickly collapseâ€”recursive subdivisions 
# in the Sierpinski Gasket and singularities in the Whitney Umbrella. However, the large 
# Wasserstein distance indicates that the overall topological structures are quite different.
# 
# **Conclusion**:
# While the low Bottleneck distance reveals some alignment between these spaces in their 
# short-lived features, the large Wasserstein distance supports the theory that fractals 
# and singular spaces have distinct large-scale topological behaviors. This provides 
# additional nuance to our understanding of how these spaces compare.

# 5. Summary of Insights
# 
# The Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances provide additional confirmation of the 
# theoretical distinctions between fractal, non-smooth, and singular spaces. Key takeaways 
# include:
# 
# - **Fractal vs. Polyhedral Spaces**: Fractals like the Sierpinski Gasket and polyhedral 
#   structures like the Triangulated Cube exhibit substantial topological differences, 
#   as reflected in their distance metrics.
# 
# - **Polyhedral vs. Singular Spaces**: The Triangulated Cube and Whitney Umbrella 
#   share some similarities in their short-lived features but remain distinct in their 
#   overall topological structure, as confirmed by moderate distance metrics.
# 
# - **Fractal vs. Singular Spaces**: Despite some unexpected similarities in short-lived 
#   features (low Bottleneck distance), fractals and singular spaces show significant 
#   large-scale differences, as indicated by their large Wasserstein distances.
# 
# These results reinforce the predictions of the theoretical framework and add new layers 
# of understanding, particularly in the behavior of short-lived topological features across 
# different types of complex spaces.

# 6. Conclusion
# 
# The additional Bottleneck and Wasserstein distance results provide quantitative support 
# for the theoretical claims about the behavior of persistent homology across fractal, 
# non-smooth, and singular spaces. While some unexpected similarities in short-lived 
# features were observed, the overall large-scale topological differences confirm that 
# these spaces exhibit distinct behaviors under persistent homology.
# 
# The combination of these distance metrics with the persistence interval analysis enhances 
# our understanding of how different types of complex spaces compare, offering both 
# theoretical insight and practical tools for topological analysis in a variety of settings.
