# This document outlines the additional results from comparing the persistence diagrams
# between different spaces using Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances. The comparisons
# focus on quantifying the topological differences between the Sierpinski Gasket, 
# Triangulated Cube, and Whitney Umbrella. These metrics provide a quantitative basis 
# for understanding the distinct topological structures of fractal, non-smooth, and 
# singular spaces.

# --- Bottleneck and Wasserstein Distance Comparisons ---

# 1. Sierpinski Gasket vs. Triangulated Cube
Comparing Sierpinski Gasket and Triangulated Cube:
Bottleneck Distance: 0.49999999999999994
Wasserstein Distance: 21.285533905932738

# Conclusion: 
# The significant Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances indicate substantial topological 
# differences between the recursive structure of the Sierpinski Gasket and the polyhedral 
# simplices of the Triangulated Cube. This supports the theoretical claim that fractal 
# spaces and non-smooth spaces have distinct topological behaviors.

# 2. Triangulated Cube vs. Whitney Umbrella
Comparing Triangulated Cube and Whitney Umbrella:
Bottleneck Distance: 0.5
Wasserstein Distance: 16.96100286421539

# Conclusion: 
# The Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances highlight both the differences and some 
# similarities between these two spaces. The Whitney Umbrella's singularities generate 
# short-lived features, which lead to a moderate Bottleneck distance but a significant 
# Wasserstein distance. This supports the theoretical distinction between singular spaces 
# and polyhedral structures, though they share some topological traits.

# 3. Sierpinski Gasket vs. Whitney Umbrella
Comparing Sierpinski Gasket and Whitney Umbrella:
Bottleneck Distance: 0.11113964894496055
Wasserstein Distance: 26.91913121377121

# Conclusion: 
# The unexpectedly low Bottleneck Distance indicates a surprising similarity in short-lived 
# features between the fractal nature of the Sierpinski Gasket and the singularities of the 
# Whitney Umbrella. However, the high Wasserstein Distance reflects the overall topological 
# differences, aligning with the theory that these spaces are fundamentally distinct in their 
# topological structure, despite some local similarities.

# Summary of Additional Insights:
# 
# - Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances provide quantitative measures of how different 
#   the topological structures are across the spaces. 
# - Sierpinski Gasket and Triangulated Cube show significant differences, confirming 
#   distinct behaviors between fractals and non-smooth spaces.
# - Whitney Umbrella and Triangulated Cube are moderately similar in some aspects but 
#   still display significant overall differences.
# - Sierpinski Gasket and Whitney Umbrella show unexpected similarities in short-lived 
#   features, but their large-scale topological structures remain distinct.
#
# These results support and add nuance to the theoretical framework, confirming that 
# fractals, non-smooth spaces, and singular varieties exhibit distinct behaviors under 
# persistent homology, though some features may align in unexpected ways.
